# video-playing-and-face detection
This code allows to play a video at a different speed and potentially in reverse depending on the
number of persons who are detected by the webcam.   


Setup :  
install Python 3.8.10  
``git clone https://github.com/ArthurMynl/video-playing-and-face-detection.git video-playing-and-face-detection/``    
``cd video-playing-and-face-detection/``      
``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``   

Before running, please be sure to write the path of the video file in config.txt (replace the ./video.mp4)
